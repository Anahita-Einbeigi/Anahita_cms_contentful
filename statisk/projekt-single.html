        <h1>My project</h1>
        <div><h2>Blanco</h2>
            <p>I developed a fully responsive e-commerce website for a fashion store, where users can browse and purchase a wide variety of clothing items. The site features a modern, user-friendly design with a smooth shopping experience. Users can filter products by categories, view product details, and complete their purchases seamlessly.This project helped me enhance my skills in front-end development, including working with JavaScript, React, and integrating APIs for real-time product updates.
